coding challenge

	apply logic to working toward a solution 

	mostly joins and aggregations 

	looking for solid logic, including approach and thought process 

	subsetting on specific populations 
		active in a period, or did a certain action 

	similar as first round
	more breadth of questions 
	might build off response to previous question 
	follow interview prompts > guiding toward follow up question 
	how do you incorporate the additional info and adapat my approach 


Case Study 

analytical reasoning 
lead conversation with structured apporach 
broadly scoped product lvel 
should we double the amount of ads on FB news feed? 


analytical execution 
narrow data level question 
user input high school name into text field, how do we validate this? 
create hypotheses, brainstom several, clearly stated to prove / disprove 
growth enagegmebt and rettnetion not just revenue 
demonstrating agility, how to I adjust to additional info 

quantitiave analysis
descriptive stats common distributions, conditional probability 
what would the curve look like 
how to calculate the probability
how to calculate the probability of a set of users seeing an add 
x number of users would calcualte y number of impressions based z reach 

anakytical reasoning 
research design
bigger product context, product makret fit, competitive landscape
do the users want it, does it aling with mission
different methods tradeoffs, esp. wrt to designing a roadmap 
mitigate bias and mitigtae network effect 

staoytelling through data 
how to combine signals from different sources to make a product recommendation 
how would you tell that story to a non technical audience 


setting goals and success is the same as analytical execution 

behavioral interivew 
describe a time whrn 
what work accoplishment are you most proud of 
time when requirements for a project change in the middle 
time when something didnt work out, how did you apply to future 
collaborating with others 
need to influence with data but not authority 
being inclusive, getting input from all stakeholders 
knowing your aduenice, how to change the msg for execs vs intern vs non technical 


	
	open ended business questions, focused on a Meta product 

	ask questions to get context

	structured apporach that is hypothesis driven

	what is the goal, what is trying to be optimized 

	try to aling on mission to create community and bring ppl closer together 

	goals on user growth, engagement, and retention 

	brainstorm different hypotheses - clearly stated, how to prove / disprove 

	metrics: focus on internal data, specify avg, count, sum
			specify as time bounds
			specify whether it pertains to a sub-population 

	balanced to note potential positive and negatives, include guardrail 


	analytical thinking & analytical doing 

		thinking: considering multiple different approaches or methods that tie back to the hypothesis 

			defining an analytical road map 

		doing: how to operationalize things: what experiments, what analyses 

			enough detail that they can replicate the experiment 

	call out bias, how can we be confident in the results
		address edge caess 

	not about any one solution, more about how I engage with the problem

	do the goals and metrics make sense, are they tied to the problem
